# System-Analysis-and-Design

-Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass was a company that saw an opening in the market and needed some software developed to fill that hole. They asked for a website where customers can purchase driving lessons and study material for DMV exams.
There was to be various training packages available and a sub-system for scheduling appointments.

-What did you do particularly well?
I did well extracting all of the requirements for the software from the sit-down interview tht was done with the client.

-If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would improve my business requirements documeent by adding details rather than just having bullet points. I can add additional information and explanations.

-How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The users need the platform to be available quickly and intuitively from any device. This is a nonfunctional requirement that I included in my design. The mobile interface must be intuitive and the mobile version must be responsive with fast load times.

-How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
My approach to software design involves stakeholder engagement for requirement gathering, followed by iterative prototyping and UML-based visualization to ensure clarity and alignment.
